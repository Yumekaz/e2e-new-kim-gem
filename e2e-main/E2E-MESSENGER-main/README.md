## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Advanced Security
- **End-to-End Encryption** - AES-256-GCM + ECDH P-256 key exchange
- **Secure File Sharing** - E2E encrypted file uploads (Images, PDFs)
- **Signed File URLs** - Time-limited, HMAC-signed download links
- **Security Headers** - Helmet.js with strict CSP
- **Zero-Knowledge** - Server stores only encrypted blobs
- **JWT Authentication** - Access tokens (15min) + refresh tokens (7 days) with rotation
- **Ephemeral Mode** - All data deleted when room owner leaves

### 📱 Mobile & Offline Ready
- **Offline-First** - Works on local network without internet
- **QR Code Joining** - Scan to join rooms instantly
- **Self-Signed HTTPS** - Built-in HTTPS server for secure mobile access
- **Mixed Mode** - Supports both Auth-based and Legacy (username-only) users

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety on frontend
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 95+ Unit (Jest) and E2E (Playwright) tests
- **Dual Server Modes** - Enhanced (Auth) and Legacy (Simple) servers
- **CI Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow for install, build, and tests

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: One-Click Setup (Recommended) ⚡
**Right-click `setup.ps1` → "Run with PowerShell" (as Administrator)**
This automatically installs dependencies, builds the client, generates SSL certs, and starts the server.

### Option B: Manual Setup

#### 1. Install & Build
```bash
npm install         # Install server deps
npm run install-all # Install client deps
npm run build       # Build React frontend
```

#### 2. Generate SSL Certificates (Required for Mobile)
```bash
mkdir ssl
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ssl/key.pem -out ssl/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=SecureChat"
```

#### 3. Start Server
```bash
npm start           # Starts enhanced server (Auth + E2E)
# OR
npm run start:legacy # Starts legacy server (No Auth, just E2E)
```

### Access URLs
| Device | URL |
|--------|-----|
| 💻 PC | `http://localhost:3000` |
| 📱 Phone | `https://YOUR_PC_IP:3443` |

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Mobile Connection

**"Site can't be reached" / "Connection timed out"?**

This is usually caused by **AP Isolation** on your phone's hotspot (blocks laptop from talking to phone).

**✅ The Fix: Use Windows Mobile Hotspot**
1. **On PC:** Settings → Network & Internet → Mobile hotspot → **Turn ON**
2. **On Phone:** Connect to the PC's hotspot WiFi
3. **Scan QR Code:** It will automatically detect the hotspot IP (e.g., `192.168.137.1`)
4. **Access:** `https://192.168.137.1:3443`

---

## 🧪 Testing

We use **Jest** for unit testing and **Playwright** for E2E testing.

```bash
# Run Unit Tests (Auth, Crypto, Logic)
npm test

# Run End-to-End Tests (Browser automation)
npm run test:e2e

# Run All Tests
npm run test:all
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ **Auth:** Registration, Login, Token Refresh, Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Rooms:** Creation, Joining, Locking, Persistence
- ✅ **Security:** Injection, XSS prevention, Error handling
- ✅ **E2E:** Full user flows (Login → Create Room → Chat → Leave)
